    feedback: `I had the pleasure of working with Rohit as our frontend engineer at Amana DeFi, where we‚Äôre building an omnichain yield aggregator to simplify DeFi investing. Rohit was responsible for building and maintaining our React + TypeScript frontend, and played a critical role in integrating our UI with smart contracts for both same-chain and cross-chain transactions.

He also worked on:

- Wallet integrations

- On-chain rating providers

- Real-time APY data via DefiLlama

- User onboarding and interface improvements

Rohit was enthusiastic, proactive, and always eager to contribute beyond his core responsibilities. He often made thoughtful suggestions across both product and technical areas ‚Äî a true team player. I‚Äôd gladly recommend him to any team looking for a skilled and dependable frontend developer in the Web3 space.`,

I had the pleasure of working side by side with Rohit. During our time, I quickly realized that he‚Äôs not only great at executing tasks ‚Äì he also comes up with ideas that push things forward in moments of conflict or during important decisions.

As a Web3 FE at Amana, Rohit faced complex tech challenges like cross-chain mechanisms, but he dug into and solved them and always showed up, even at late hours.

Having Rohit as a colleague or partner on your side brings many, many benefits!
